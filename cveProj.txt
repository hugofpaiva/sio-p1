	OSVDB:OSVDB:3292
		The PHP web application, Advanced Poll, contains a flaw that may allow a malicious user to sensitive information about the server. The issue is triggered when a request is made to the misc/info.php script that is included with a standard installation. This script simply executes the phpinfo() function and displays the results. It is possible that the flaw may allow an unauthorized remote user to view server path information, environment variables, and internal version numbers of installed libraries. cvss 5.0 ai vulners score 6.2

		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2017:3277-1. PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \x00 character in certain situations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and access files or directories with unexpected names via a crafted argument to (1) set_include_path, (2) tempnam, (3) rmdir, or (4) readlink. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243. CVSS SCORE 7.3

	Out-of-bounds Read / CVE-2019-11042
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read. When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.31, 7.2.x below 7.2.21 and 7.3.x below 7.3.8 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash. CVSS SCORE 7.1

	SUSE-SU-2016:2460-1 / CVE-2016-4473
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2016:2460-1. /ext/phar/phar_object.c in PHP 7.0.7 and 5.6.x allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. NOTE: Introduced as part of an incomplete fix to CVE-2015-6833. CVSS SCORE 9.8
	
	SUSE-SU-2016:2460-2 / CVE-2016-4473
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2016:2460-2. /ext/phar/phar_object.c in PHP 7.0.7 and 5.6.x allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. NOTE: Introduced as part of an incomplete fix to CVE-2015-6833. CVSS SCORE 9.8

	SUSE-SU-2017:0534-1 / CVE-2017-5340
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2017:0534-1. Zend/zend_hash.c in PHP before 7.0.15 and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 mishandles certain cases that require large array allocations, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow, uninitialized memory access, and use of arbitrary destructor function pointers) via crafted serialized data.

	SUSE-SU-2016:2397-1 / CVE-2016-6354
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2016:2397-1.

CVSS SCORE 9.8
	
	SUSE-SU-2016:2661-1 / CVE-2016-7567
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2016:2661-1. Buffer overflow in the SLPFoldWhiteSpace function in common/slp_compare.c in OpenSLP 2.0 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted string. CVSS SCORE 9.8

	SUSE-SU-2018:1916-1 / CVE-2017-17833
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2018:1916-1. OpenSLP releases in the 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 code streams have a heap-related memory corruption issue which may manifest itself as a denial-of-service or a remote code-execution vulnerability. CVSS SCORE 9.8

	Out-of-bounds Write / CVE-2019-5544 
		OpenSLP as used in ESXi and the Horizon DaaS appliances has a heap overwrite issue. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the Critical severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 9.8.

	SUSE-SU-2018:0100-1 / CVE-2016-4912
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2018:0100-1. The _xrealloc function in xlsp_xmalloc.c in OpenSLP 2.0.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a large number of crafted packets, which triggers a memory allocation failure. CVSS SCORE 7.5

	SUSE-SU-2015:0922-1 / CVE-2012-4428
		Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SUSE-SU-2015:0922-1 openslp: SLPIntersectStringList()' Function has a DoS vulnerability 7.5
